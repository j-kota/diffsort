# diffsort
An implementation of the main concepts introduced in Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking by Blondel et al., 2020

The differentiable ranking operator is define in full within softRank.py
A learning experiment which utilizes the operator is implemented in dnnRanks.py
An implementation of differentiable sorting, still under construction, is available in fwdSort.py
